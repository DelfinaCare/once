# Before we begin, a note on the assert statements in this file:
# Why are we using assert in here, you might ask, instead of implementing "proper" error handling?
# In this case, it is actually not being done out of laziness! The assert statements here
# represent our assumptions about the state at that point in time, and are always called with locks
# held, so they **REALLY** should always hold. If the assumption behind one of these asserts fails,
# the subsequent calls are going to fail anyways, so it's not like they are making the code
# artificially brittle. However, they do make testing easer, because we can directly test our
# assumption instead of having hard-to-trace errors, and also serve as very convenient
# documentation of the assumptions.
# We are always open to suggestions if there are other ways to achieve the same functionality in
# python!

    Even though the class stores a result, all of the methods separately take a result input.
    Why is that? Great question.

    While yielding results simultaneously from multiple tasks or threads, we want to support
    configurable outcomes for exception handling. Specifically, taking `result` as an argument is
    critical in order to support any *already executing* iterators finishing with their cached
    result and exception, but restarting new iterators from the beginning. This is done by creating
    a local reference to `result` when the iterator is started and passing that around thereafter.

    When an Exception occurs and reset_on_exception, we begin the execution again from the
    beginning for all new iterators. This is required because the received values during execution
    may be critical to the returned. For example, imagine a caller of a paginated API who chose to
    user iterator.send to propagate the next token. Given that the state of the output might depend
    on the state of what was received, to be semantically correct, we must start from the
    beginning.

    # Why do we make the generating boolean property abstract?
    # This makes the code when the iterator state is WAITING more efficient. If this was simply
    # a boolean property, the iterator wrapper implementation would need a "sleep(0)" operation
    # whenever it was in the WAITING state. However, this lets the underlying event use a more
    # semantically appropriate event to implement the state of generating, which it can then also
    # wait on whenever it needs to handle the WAITING case. In both cases, the underlying function
    # of event.wait() is the same as the sleep(0), but the appropriate semantics make the logic
    # clearer.
    # Why would we have needed a sleep(0)
    # In the async case, the coroutine in WAITING state would be waiting for the leader (in state
    # GENERATING) to finish generating the result, but because WAITING would have control of the
    # lock, it will never yield execution to the event loop for GENERATING to execute,causing an
    # infinite loop. An await sleep(0) would trigger this yielding of execution, allowing the event
    # loop to loop through to the GENERATING so it can complete and unblock the WAITING coroutine.
    # In the sync case, we also need a sleep(0) for a different reason. While a thread is in the
    # WAITING state, it would otherwise hog the Global Interpreter Lock in its while loop until
    # the interprer decides to switch threads. With N threads, N - 1 of them would be in the
    # WAITING state, and a round-robin interpreter would give each of their while loops the
    # thread switching time in execution before reaching the single thread in the GENERATING state.
    # Theoretically, this could result in the GIL only working on the thread in the GENERATING
    # state 1/Nth of the time, without a time.sleep(0) to manually trigger a GIL switch. In
    # practice, removing the time.sleep(0) call would result in large drops in performance when
    # running the multithreaded unit tests.
